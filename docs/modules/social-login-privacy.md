# Social Login Privacy — Pseudonymous Platform Access

> **Status:** Spec Draft | **Priority:** Tier 2 (after Age Verification + Student Discount)
> **Regulation:** EU Digital Services Act (DSA), GDPR Art. 25, eIDAS 2.0
> **Market:** 4+ billion social media users globally

---

## Problem

Platforms increasingly require identity verification (DSA Art. 16a). Current solutions:

| Current Practice | Privacy Impact |
|---|---|
| "Login with Google/Facebook" | Shares name, email, photo, friends, location — everything |
| "Upload ID to Meta" | Sends government ID copy to a private company |
| Phone number verification | Links real identity, enables cross-platform tracking |

**Result:** Users must choose between platform access and privacy. There is no middle ground.

## miTch Solution: Pseudonymous Verified Login

miTch enables platform login that proves **what the platform legally needs** while sharing **nothing else**.

### What the Platform Gets

| Attribute | Type | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| `age_gte_18` | Predicate (boolean) | 🟢 Low — no birthday, just threshold |
| `pseudonymous_id` | Pairwise DID | 🟢 Low — unique per platform, unlinkable across services |
| `is_real_person` | Predicate (boolean) | 🟢 Low — humanity proof via credential chain |
| `eu_resident` | Predicate (boolean) | 🟢 Low — jurisdiction only, no address |

### What the Platform Does NOT Get

| Blocked Attribute | Risk Level | Deny Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `display_name` | 🟡 Raw PII | `DENY_PII_UNNECESSARY` |
| `email` | 🟡 Raw PII | `DENY_PII_UNNECESSARY` |
| `profile_photo` | 🔴 Biometric | `DENY_BIOMETRIC_BLOCKED` |
| `friends_list` | 🔴 Social Graph | `DENY_SOCIAL_GRAPH_BLOCKED` |
| `location_history` | 🔴 Tracking | `DENY_LOCATION_BLOCKED` |
| `device_id` | 🔴 Fingerprint | `DENY_DEVICE_FINGERPRINT_BLOCKED` |

These are **structural blocks** — the Policy Engine denies them regardless of user consent. The data never leaves the wallet, not even encrypted.

## Architecture

### Flow

```
Platform (FlirtRadar, TikTok, etc.)
    │
    ├─ OID4VP Request: age, name, email, photo, friends, location, device_id
    │
    ▼
miTch Policy Engine
    │
    ├─ ALLOW: age_gte_18 (predicate)
    ├─ ALLOW: pseudonymous_id (pairwise DID, HKDF-derived)
    ├─ ALLOW: is_real_person (credential chain proof)
    ├─ ALLOW: eu_resident (jurisdiction predicate)
    │
    ├─ DENY: display_name      → DENY_PII_UNNECESSARY
    ├─ DENY: email              → DENY_PII_UNNECESSARY
    ├─ DENY: profile_photo      → DENY_BIOMETRIC_BLOCKED
    ├─ DENY: friends_list       → DENY_SOCIAL_GRAPH_BLOCKED
    ├─ DENY: location_history   → DENY_LOCATION_BLOCKED
    ├─ DENY: device_id          → DENY_DEVICE_FINGERPRINT_BLOCKED
    │
    ▼
Platform receives: { age_gte_18: true, pseudonymous_id: "pw-...", is_real_person: true, eu_resident: true }
```

### Pseudonymous ID (Pairwise DID)

- Generated via HKDF from user master key + platform DID
- **Unique per platform** — FlirtRadar and TikTok get different IDs
- **Stable per platform** — same user gets same ID on repeat login (session continuity)
- **Unlinkable** — no way to correlate IDs across platforms
- Implementation: `@mitch/shared-crypto` → `derivePairwiseDID()`

### Overreaching Detection

When a platform requests attributes beyond what's necessary for login:

1. **Per-attribute risk scoring:**
   - 🟢 Predicates (age, residency) → Low risk
   - 🟡 Raw PII (name, email) → Medium risk, blocked by default
   - 🔴 Biometric/Social/Location → High risk, structurally blocked

2. **Inference warning:** "With age + region + login time, the platform could narrow down your approximate profile → Risk: 🟡 Medium"

3. **Collective Signal:** Users can flag platforms as "overreaching" with one tap. When enough users flag the same platform (threshold: configurable, e.g. 500), the system:
   - Adds the platform to a public transparency feed
   - Auto-generates a DSA complaint template
   - No individual attribution — flags are aggregated anonymously

## Comparison: miTch vs. Current Login Methods

| Attribute | Login with Google | Login with Apple | miTch |
|---|---|---|---|
| Real name | ✅ Shared | ✅ Shared | ❌ Blocked |
| Email | ✅ Shared | ⚠️ Relay option | ❌ Blocked |
| Profile photo | ✅ Shared | ❌ Not shared | ❌ Blocked |
| Friends/contacts | ⚠️ API access | ❌ Not shared | ❌ Structurally blocked |
| Location | ⚠️ Via Google account | ❌ Not shared | ❌ Structurally blocked |
| Device fingerprint | ✅ Shared | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ Blocked |
| Age verified | ❌ Not verified | ❌ Not verified | ✅ Cryptographic proof |
| Cross-platform tracking | ✅ Same Google ID | ⚠️ Possible | ❌ Pairwise IDs, unlinkable |
| Humanity proof | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Credential chain |

**Key differentiator:** Apple's "Hide My Email" is a step forward but still shares a relay address. miTch shares **no contact information at all** — the platform gets a pseudonymous ID and verified predicates, nothing more.

## DSA Compliance Argument

The EU Digital Services Act (2024) requires platforms to:
- Verify user identity for certain services (Art. 16a)
- Implement trusted flaggers and complaint mechanisms (Art. 22)
- Provide transparency about content moderation (Art. 15)

**miTch enables DSA compliance without mass surveillance:**
- Platforms can verify "real person, 18+, EU resident" ✓
- Users retain privacy while meeting legal requirements ✓
- Overreaching platforms face collective accountability ✓

## Demo Scenario: FlirtRadar™

A fictional dating app with low trust score (35/100) requests maximum data:

1. **Request:** 7 attributes including biometrics and social graph
2. **miTch Analyse:** 🔴 High risk — structural blocks active on 5/7 fields
3. **Proof:** Pseudonymous login generated (age + pairwise ID only)
4. **Result:** "App wanted everything — got almost nothing"
5. **Flag option:** User can report FlirtRadar as overreaching

## Implementation Dependencies

| Component | Package | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Pairwise DID derivation | `@mitch/shared-crypto` | ✅ Implemented |
| `isOver18` predicate | `@mitch/predicates` | ✅ Implemented |
| Policy Engine deny codes | `@mitch/policy-engine` | ✅ Implemented (needs social-login-specific rules) |
| OID4VP presentation flow | `@mitch/oid4vp` | ✅ Implemented |
| Collective Signal | `@mitch/policy-engine` | ⚠️ Concept only (see student-discount-ibk.md) |
| Social-login policy rules | `@mitch/policy-engine` | ❌ Not yet implemented |
| DSA complaint generator | — | ❌ Not yet implemented |

### New Deny Codes Needed

```typescript
// Social Login specific deny codes
DENY_BIOMETRIC_BLOCKED        // profile_photo, fingerprint, voice
DENY_SOCIAL_GRAPH_BLOCKED     // friends_list, contacts, followers
DENY_LOCATION_BLOCKED         // location_history, GPS, cell tower
DENY_DEVICE_FINGERPRINT_BLOCKED // device_id, hardware_id, IMEI
```

---

## Roadmap

1. **Now:** Documentation + demo (this document + standalone.html) ✅
2. **Next:** Add social-login deny codes to Policy Engine
3. **Next:** Create social-login policy rule template
4. **Later:** Collective Signal aggregation (shared with Student Discount use case)
5. **Future:** DSA complaint auto-generation
6. **Future:** Platform adoption outreach (start with privacy-first platforms)
